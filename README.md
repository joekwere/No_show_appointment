SUMMARY
In this project, I investigated a dataset of medical records to determine if patients show up for their medical appointment.

INTRODUCTION
I worked with a dataset known as 'No show Appointment'.
This dataset is focused on patients and how they keep up with their medical appointments.
I analyzed a number of characteristics about patients and how they relate to their medical appointments.
This dataset contains 14 columns and some of them are;
* PatientID - This is a unique identifier for all patients.
* AppointmentID - This is also a unique identifier for every appointment.
* Gender - This indicates the gender of patient.
* ScheduledDay - It shows the date the an appointment was created.
* AppointmentDay - This shows the actual day of the appointment.
* Age - This indicates the age of the patient.
* Neighbourhood - This tells us the location of the hospital.

Question(s) for Analysis
I will be analysing the following questions from the given dataset.

* What percentage of each variable booked appointment?
* Are patients from each variable caterory likely to show up for their appointment?
* Which hospital has the highest appointment booking.
* which hospital was visited the most in relation to their appointment
* What age has the highest number of appointment and what age kept to their appointment the most
